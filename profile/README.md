# 🌩️ DaeCloud

Welcome to **DaeCloud** — a small, experimental space where I build whatever interesting ideas come to mind.  
No strict roadmap, no corporate nonsense — just projects that are useful, fun, or solve a problem I ran into.

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here

- Lightweight tools and services  
- Automation experiments  
- Self-hosted and DevOps-friendly setups  
- Utilities built because “nothing existing did exactly what I wanted”

## 🧰 Tech & Approach

- Build it fast, build it clean  
- Dockerised everything  
- Keep things reproducible and portable  
- Prefer simplicity over over-engineering

## 📦 Projects

Expect a mix of:

- APIs  
- CLI tools  
- Automation scripts  
- Self-hostable apps  
- Random ideas turned into working prototypes

## 🌐 Philosophy

DaeCloud exists purely for building. If something seems interesting, useful, or worth exploring — it gets built.
